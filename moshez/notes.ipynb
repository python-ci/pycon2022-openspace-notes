    "  * Actionability -- if you take advantage containers\n",
    "* CI is often stateless and lacks caching -- this can make things much slower\n",
    "  * Caching support is either rudimentary or doesn't exist\n",
    "  * Best thing you can hope for is save/restory directory\n",
    "  * For example, caching the state of your build\n",
    "  * Directory save/restore doesn't interact well with concurrency\n",
    "  * It can also be slow, so not a win\n",
    "  * Fine-grained caching: an explicit \"cache this fact for this build\"\n",
    "  * This can also make the \"Cache directory\" bigger and bigger\n",

    "* Sometimes CI is related to compliance (e.g., health, finance)\n",
    "* At what point can CI use synthetic data? This is not always trivial\n",
    "  * This can become important for systems interacting with physical data gathering devices, like health measurement data\n",
    "  * It can be useful to break it into the parts that interact with real-world things, and to the parts that are purely software/computers.\n",
    "  * Realistic synthetic data is important -- lightning talk yesterday!\n",
    "* Chris is giving a talk about Pants tomorrow!"
